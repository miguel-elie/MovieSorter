         *
         *  @par Motivation
         *  By storing CSV strings in a giant string (as opposed to an
         *  `std::vector` of smaller strings), we vastly reduce the number
         *  of calls to `malloc()`, thus speeding up the program.
         *  However, by doing so we will need a way to tell where different
         *  fields are located within this giant string.
         *  Hence, an array of indices is also maintained.
         *
         *  @warning
         *  `reset()` should be called somewhat often in the code. Since each
         *  `csv::CSVRow` contains an `std::shared_ptr` to a RawRowBuffer,
         *  the buffers do not get deleted until every CSVRow referencing it gets
         *  deleted. If RawRowBuffers get very large, then so will memory consumption.
         *  Currently, `reset()` is called by `csv::CSVReader::feed()` at the end of 
         *  every sequence of bytes parsed.
